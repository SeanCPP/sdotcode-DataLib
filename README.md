# sdotcode-DataLib
A database-agnostic, *write-once, run everywhere* repository pattern implementation for an entire dotnet ```.solution```.
This isn't intended to replace any ORM or database libraries. This is a symmetrical repository pattern that allows you to handle data access in *every* dotnet application in your solution in a consistent, elegant way.

  Since certain tasks (in regard to data acess) have become so trivialized by the abstractions brought into the .net ecosystem, we can start *DRY*ing our code across the tech stack pretty seamlessly. The repository pattern can be mirrored between the back-end and the front-end, which provides you a seamless approach to dealing with boring CRUD operations across layers of the tech stack.

# Using this as your **_solution-wide_** repository layer

### Model class
```csharp
[TableName("People")]
public class IPersonModel : IStoredItem
{
    public virtual int Id { get; set; }
    
    [Searchable]
    public virtual string? Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

### Service class
```csharp
public class PersonService : Service<IPersonModel>
{
    public PersonService(IDataStore<IPersonModel> dataStore) : base(dataStore) { }
}
```

 ### The PeopleController class (if using the API features)
 ```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class PeopleController : ExtendedControllerBase<PersonModel>
{
    public PeopleController(Service<PersonModel> service) : base(service) { }
}
```
By subclassing the ExtendedControllerBase in your code, you get a fully-functioning CRUD+Search API for that model class generated automatically:

![Auto-generated API example](/api.PNG?raw=true "Example image demonstrating the API generated by the system")


With these classes set up and registered in the DI container, you could now utilize Service<PersonModel> in any project in the solution and perform CRUD and Search operations in an API controller, Blazor component, Xamarin/MAUI app, etc.

### Blazor component
```csharp
@foreach(var person in people)
{
    <p>@person.Id - @person.Name</p>
}

<input type="text" @bind-value=nameSearch />
<button @onclick=Search>Search</button>

@code {
    [Inject] Service<PersonModel>? service { get; set; }

    private string nameSearch = string.Empty;

    IEnumerable<PersonModel> people = new List<PersonModel>();

    private async Task Search()
    {
        people = await service!.SearchAsync(nameSearch, 
            pagingOptions: default,
            x => x.Name, 
            x => x.Id); // This won't get searched since the Id property on PersonModel doesn't have [Searchable]
    }
}
```

## The IDataStore interface
In order to make this work, we need to plug an IDataStore implemenation into the DI containers of each application. So far, there are two (2) built-in IDataStore implementations (more are coming):
**InMemoryDataStore** and **HttpClientDataStore**

**Note** If you need an IDataStore for your database/data source, simply implement the IDataStore<T> interface.
  
The **InMemoryDataStore** is an in-memory data store that can be used for mocking / testing.

 The **HttpClientDataStore** is more interesting. 
 
### The HttpClientDataStore
   
When using the Service class with HttpClientDataStore registered as the IDataStore, the Service will make HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods behind the scenes. 

If you need to add role authorization to any controller method, you can always override the method in your controller and add the [Authorize] attribute:
```csharp
[Authorize]
public override Task<ActionResult> Upsert([FromBody] IEnumerable<PersonModel> items) => base.Upsert(items);
```

## Wiring up the DI
  
It's important to note that in order for the system to automatically wire up and communicate with the API, the HttpClient must be properly configured to point to the API project, and your API project must allow CORS from your front-end applcation.
  
### The Blazor project's Program.cs
```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:7051/") }); // URL to the API project

builder.Services.AddScoped<IDataStore<IPersonModel>, HttpClientDataStore<IPersonModel>>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<Service<IPersonModel>, PersonService>();
```

### The API Project's Program.cs
```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IDataStore<IPersonModel>, InMemoryDataStore<IPersonModel>>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<Service<IPersonModel>, PersonServiceMock>();
  
var MyAllowSpecificOrigins = "_myAllowSpecificOrigins";
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy(
        name: MyAllowSpecificOrigins,
        policy =>
        {
            policy.WithOrigins("https://localhost:7220"); // URL to the front-end application that makes requests to this API
        });
});

var app = builder.Build();

// Later on...
app.UseCors(MyAllowSpecificOrigins);
```
  
## Additional notes
  
  ### Error Handling
  
  A side effect to the way this is designed is that debugging your data access layer while developing actually becomes much simpler.
  If you override the ```OnException(Exception ex)``` method in your Service class and leave a breakpoint inside it, you will automatically hit the stop _if a data access error occurs in any **application** in your solution during runtime._ This is equivilent to setting a breakpoint in every ```catch(){ }``` statement in your Entity's repository. 
  
  Furthermore, if you set a breakpoint inside the HandleException method of an ```IDataStore```, you'll hit a stop _if a data access error occurs in any **application** for **every single Entity** in your solution during runtime._ (as long as it's using that ```IDataStore```) which is, a lot of power for one breakpoint. And is in my opinion, overall pretty cool.
  
```csharp
public class PersonService : Service<PersonModel>
{
    public PersonService(IDataStore<PersonModel> dataStore) : base(dataStore) { }

    protected override Task OnException(Exception ex)
    {
        return base.OnException(ex);
    }
}
```

  ### Heads up
  
  If you plan on using this as an out-of-the-box solution, I'd highly recommend forking the project instead of cloning it directly from here. This is very much so a work-in-progress, and it might change. This is not a stable, production-ready product yet, as ideas are being experimented with and improved upon. This project does not make any promises regarding security or stability of data access. You'll need to rely on applying security measures (auth, roles, etc) to the data access in API controllers and database operations as you normally would elsewhere. 
  
  This can become a stable production-ready product with the help of community contributions. If this seems like something you or your company could benefit from, feel free to get involved!
